# Binary Search Java Program

A simple Java program that demonstrates the binary search algorithm. This program allows users to input an array, sort it, and then search for a specific value within the array.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you run the Java program on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

### Running the Program

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/binary-search-java.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.

3. Run the `Main.java` file.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input an array, specify a value to search for, and see the result.

## Usage

The program prompts you to enter the size of the array and the elements of the array. It then sorts the array and performs a binary search for the specified value. If the value is found, it will display a message indicating that the value was found.
